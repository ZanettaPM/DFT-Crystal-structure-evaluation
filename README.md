# DFT-Crystal-structure-evaluation

This repository contains several data processing procedures used in Zanetta et al. 2022. The structure has been relaxed using a step-by-step ISIF 7 2 7 2 procedure, as detailed in Zanetta et al. 2022, which also explains the data tree organization.

Three sections are presented using Structure NÂ°10 as an example:

Space Group Symmetry Estimation
Bond Distance Measurement
Force Evolution During Convergence of Calculations

Please note that POTCAR and VASPRUN files have been removed from all directories to save memory space on GitHub.

For more details, refer to the original paper by Zanetta et al. 2022.
