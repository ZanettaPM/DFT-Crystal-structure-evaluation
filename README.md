# DFT-Crystal-structure-evaluation

Please find several data processing procedures used in Zanetta et al. 2022. The structure has been relaxed in a ISIF 7 2 7 2 step by step procedure see Zanetta et al. 2022, which explain the data tree organisation. 

Three sections are presented using the Structure NÂ°10 as an example; the space group symmetry estimation, the bond distance mesurement and the force evolution during the convergence of the calculations. 

POTCAR and VASPRUN files were removed from all the files in order to gain memory space on github.
